# SuperPump
**29 May 2016 - 15 June 2016**

## About
Super Pump was developed independently as part of a volunteer project with Steve Engels from the University of Toronto. The goal of the game is to promote a more interective educational environmental with students of all ages, ranging from the elementary to high school levels. As such, Super Pump was created in mind to aid in mental math and general estimation with quick calculations regarding gas prices and customer money. Concepts include fractions, percentages, addition, multiplication and rounding.

## Rules & Controls
The top row keys 1,2,3,4 control the pumps, and the mouse interacts wtih buttons.

You play as a Gas Attendant whose job is to fill up incoming cars with the correct amount of gas based on the current price (dollar per litre). Each customer displays the amount of money that they have, and it is your job to stop the filling amount at the correct time. So for example, if the price per litre is $1.33 and the customer has $6.00 on hand, then ideally students would estimate that the $0.33 is roughly 1/3 reduction in fuel. Instead of filling 6 litres, they would roughly reduce that amount by 33% or 1/3 to fill 4 litres.

## Credits
All art assets were created by me, with .psds and certain time milestones included. Sound effects credited to an osu! skin pack. Music credited to some royalty-free website (sorry, I didn't note it at the time).

## Comments
This game uses the legacy GUIText system instead of the new UI/Canvas one, as the official Unity Space Shooter tutorial did not cover it. There is also no keyboard UI support or volume changes or level select. Super Pump is also the second game I've ever made on Unity, and since it was initially personal (before I decided to add it to GitHub), there isn't much code documentation. Special thanks to Spriter's Resource, Google, and Pixel Joint for their wonderous art assets that I referenced for inspiration. Thanks for reading and have a nice day :)
